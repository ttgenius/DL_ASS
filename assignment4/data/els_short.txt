speech from the throne 
resumption of debate on address in reply 
first i congratulate you on your re-election to the chair . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
mr. preston manning : 
i congratulate the leader of the conservative party and his colleagues . 
i congratulate the right hon. prime minister . 
he has had a long career in politics . 
we would have preferred his victory to ours . 
it does not belong to my party . 
it is their seat . 
i suggest they were saying four things . 
there is a message in that of *UNK* . 
there is a message in that . 
the third is one of the most interesting things . 
the bloc is exclusively a quebec party . 
we see ourselves as having a twofold mandate . 
i want to commend the government where it deserves *UNK* . 
the throne speech *UNK* to look ahead . 
it had run out of *UNK* . 
macdonald , the guiding light , was gone . 
the throne speech quotes sir wilfrid laurier . 
he was talking about fiscal realities . 
we want to examine the dry bones . 
we want to give credit where credit is due . 
let me look first at the economy . 
the government proposes little with respect to the economy . 
it mentions none of the resource sectors . 
it mentions nothing about the manufacturing sector . 
where are the principles that will guide us on these issues ? 
let me talk for a moment about the social safety net . 
we agree with that assessment . 
she was going to have parole reform . 
our hearts go out to them . 
that was the government ' s position in 1995 . 
as i say , we see now some modest changes . 
these changes are far too small . 
let me mention what some of these would be . 
the paragraph reads : 
we have no quarrel with that . 
it could start by doing two things . 
it *UNK* the 1982 constitution . 
but what has been our experience ? 
we forgive him in *UNK* . 
and what did trudeau say ? 
he drives very , very slowly . 
mr. prime minister , are we there yet ? 
i have a list two pages long . 
we would enact bills to strengthen the economic and canadian union . 
where is the parallel bill ? 
where is the bill to get that ? 
this house is supposed to be looking ahead . 
we should set the mechanisms up in advance . 
even diefenbaker had a vision of the north . 
i ask the government members to listen for a moment . 
it demonstrates it every day . 
perhaps some would say that dry bones are enough . 
to sum up , i move : 
the speaker : 
right hon. jean chrétien ( prime minister , lib. ) : 
this is the *UNK* time i have been elected to parliament . 
we have *UNK* economic *UNK* . 
we will invest in children , our most precious resource . 
i was in the house when we did that . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
right hon. jean chrétien : 
there is a new optimism in canada . 
now we must move forward together into a new millennium . 
people also need our help . 
youth unemployment is simply too high . 
that is what we are going to do . 
the foreign minister deserves our congratulations for a job well done . 
it is a message that should be heard . 
nothing more should be read into it . 
our *UNK* is confusion . 
our young will do so in the next century . 
their *UNK* will be new but it will be canadian . 
*UNK* may have a different meaning but it will be canadian . 
this country will be a model to the world . 
people see canada as the country to look at . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
mr. gilles duceppe ( laurier-sainte-marie , bq ) : 
the worst interference ever seen in the history of canada . 
and that ' s saying something . 
are we going to have national *UNK* in that sector ? 
never . 
that is canada ' s bilingual character . 
now more than ever , we *UNK* sovereignty to be necessary . 
this is the root cause of the *UNK* . 
canadians are a people . 
the aboriginal peoples are made up of several peoples . 
people all over the world are divided into various peoples . 
we see things differently . 
we believe that canada is at a *UNK* . 
this is a dead end street . 
in concluding , i move : 
the speaker : 
the amendment is in order . 
we now have a few minutes for questions and comments . 
ms. alexa mcdonough ( halifax , ndp ) : 
those publications talked about a more democratic canada . 
this parliament must focus on *UNK* that kind of canada . 
women are the most vulnerable . 
canadian families and canada ' s children are still waiting . 
what is really happening with medicare ? 
who bears the *UNK* ? 
i want to be fair . 
there is one solid government achievement that we all celebrate . 
i want to give credit where it is due . 
every canadian can be proud of this achievement . 
the speaker : 
ms. alexa mcdonough : 
i appreciate and respect the time limits . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
hon. jean j. charest ( sherbrooke , pc ) : 
what a contrast with the last legislature . 
they are remarkable . 
there always was , by the way . 
their memory is so selective . 
thank god we had trade agreements . 
what do we have today ? 
he wants to sign deals with *UNK* . 
he wants to sign deals with israel . 
he cannot get enough of it . 
what is the record they are applauding ? 
this was unprecedented : a 40 per cent cut in funding . 
was there any consultation ? 
the health care system in this country is suffering . 
the health care system in this country is threatened . 
we could have expected a canadian agenda . 
what did we get instead ? 
the usual *UNK* of goodwill . 
about half a million young canadians are out of work . 
i think it is more than 400,000 . 
that is the great initiative of this liberal government . 
we *UNK* ' ' 
there were many messages sent in the campaign . 
so a message was sent to them . 
what did we get instead ? 
this was in 1995 . 
and do you know what happened , mr. speaker ? 
guess what ? 
that is what they did . 
what has changed in the meantime ? 
why ? 
there is still an opportunity . 
let me share a secret with the prime minister . 
his position on health care is untenable . 
it is not going to work . 
the deputy speaker : 
order . 
hon. jean j. charest : 
the government had an opportunity . 
this government works on a few *UNK* . 
that is the liberal philosophy . 
it is written nicely . 
that is the way it goes . 
the government could have offered a different course to the country . 
are they listening ? 
no , they are heckling . 
maybe i am not convincing . 
maybe i am too partisan . 
do members think that le conseil du *UNK* is too partisan ? 
i do not think so . 
i hope the government will learn . 
mr. peter mackay : 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
hon. jean j. charest : 
mr. speaker , the government speaks of taxes . 
it speaks of trade . 
a new balance of responsibilities will be established in the federation . 
again i will offer some advice to my colleague . 
can i make a humble suggestion to him . 
who would object to that ? 
pension reform will also be very important . 
the government has a hidden agenda . 
middle class canadians are going to get *UNK* by the government . 
they are going to be affected . 
we want the government to come clean . 
this is a payroll tax . 
they cannot be replaced . 
and we only react to what it does . 
we will move forward if we can do so together . 
that is one of the lessons . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. chuck strahl : 
i think it is time to wrap it up . 
the deputy speaker : 
the hon. member has not raised a point of order . 
he is simply making a representation . 
hon. jean j. charest : 
i do not want to dwell on that . 
the deputy speaker :
