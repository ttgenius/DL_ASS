Investors are *UNKING* to the Securities and Exchange Commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders . STOP
A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the *UNKS* of information on insider trades as a *UNKING* tool , individual investors and professional money managers contend . STOP
They make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that , among other things , would exempt many *UNK-* executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares . STOP
The proposed changes also would allow executives to report *UNKS* of options later and less often . STOP
Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so *UNK* by the 1987 stock market crash -- and the markets already so *UNKED* against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on *UNKING* patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether . STOP
`` The SEC has historically paid *UNK* to the ideal of a level playing field , '' wrote *CUNK* S. *CUNK* of *CUNK* , Ill. , in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17 . STOP
`` *CUNKLY* the commission did not really believe in this ideal . '' STOP
Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction . STOP
But about 25 % of the insiders , according to SEC figures , file their reports late . STOP
The changes were proposed in an effort to *UNK* federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the *UNKS* , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes . STOP
Investors , money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , Mr. Lane said . STOP
The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year , he said . STOP
Not all those who wrote oppose the changes . STOP
The Committee on Federal *CUNKION* of Securities for the American *CUNK* Association argues , for example , in its lengthy letter to the SEC , that the proposed changes `` would substantially improve the -LCB- law -RCB- by *UNKING* it more closely to *UNK* business *UNKS* . '' STOP
What the investors who oppose the proposed changes *UNK* to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot *UNK* `` *UNKS* '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time . STOP
According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third . STOP
The SEC 's Mr. Lane *UNKLY* disputed those estimates . STOP
The rules will eliminate filings *UNKING* divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. Lane said . STOP
The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said . STOP
Companies would be *UNKED* to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time . STOP
*CUNKED* as a whole , Mr. Lane said , the filings required under the proposed rules `` will be at least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions . '' STOP
But Robert *CUNK* , president of *CUNK* , a North Miami , Fla. , company that packages and sells the *UNKING* data , said the proposal is *UNKED* so *UNKLY* that key officials may fail to file the reports . STOP
Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later . STOP
But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC *UNKS* who files , the law tells them when to do so . STOP
Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress , he added . STOP
The SEC would likely be *UNK* to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more *UNKLY* basis , he said . STOP
The nation 's largest pension fund , which oversees $ 80 billion for college employees , plans to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants . STOP
The *CUNKS* Insurance and *CUNK* *CUNK-* *CUNK* *CUNKS* Fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in `` *UNKLY* responsible '' companies , and a bond fund . STOP
Both funds are expected to begin operation around March 1 , subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval . STOP
For its employees to sign up for the options , a college also must approve the plan . STOP
Some *UNKN* institutions are part of the pension fund . STOP
The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to *UNK* its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the SEC in December . STOP
The new `` social choice '' fund will *UNK* securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland . STOP
Also *UNKED* will be investments in companies with `` significant '' business stemming from weapons manufacture , *UNK* *UNKS* or tobacco . STOP
*CUNK* percent of the fund will be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments . STOP
The bond fund will invest in *UNK-* or *UNK-* bonds , mortgages or asset-backed securities , including as much as 15 % in foreign securities . STOP
The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department . STOP
Under two new features , participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or , if their jobs are terminated , receive cash from the funds . STOP
The investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund , an *UNK* and a money-market fund . STOP
New *CUNK* *CUNK* Co. , a maker of biotechnology *UNKION* and equipment , said it adopted an *UNKER* plan giving shareholders the right to purchase shares at half price under certain conditions . STOP

*CUNK* *UNK* players have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because their *UNK* and audience appeal are limited . STOP
The *UNK* *CUNK* *CUNKER* has taken a hard line about the problem : He commissions and *UNKLY* *UNKS* *UNK* *UNK* scores and does some conducting , so he does n't have to play the same *CUNK* and *CUNKS* *UNKS* over and over again . STOP
Richard Stoltzman has taken a *UNKER* , more *UNKLY* approach . STOP
*CUNKS* ago , he *UNKED* with the new music *UNKS* Peter *CUNK* and *CUNKED* *CUNK* in the very *UNKAL* chamber group *CUNK* , which won audiences over to *UNKED* *UNK* scores like *CUNK* 's `` *CUNK* for the *CUNK* of Time . '' STOP
Today , the *UNK-* *UNK* has mostly dropped the *UNK* work -LRB- though a touch of the old *CUNK* still *UNKS* -RRB- and now goes on the road with *UNK* , *UNKS* , a slide show , and a *UNK* that ranges from light *UNKAL* to light *UNK* to light pop , with a few *UNK* exceptions . STOP
Just the thing for the *CUNK-* set , the *UNK* audience that has embraced New *CUNK* as its very own easy listening . STOP
But you ca n't *UNKS* Mr. Stoltzman 's music or his *UNKS* as merely commercial and *UNK* . STOP
He believes in what he plays , and he plays *UNKLY* . STOP
His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dubbed `` A *CUNKAL* *CUNK* , '' was a case in point . STOP
It felt more like a party , or a highly *UNKED* *UNK* session with a few friends , than a *UNKAL* *UNK* . STOP
*CUNK* in his *UNK* black *UNK* suit , the *UNK-* *UNK* announced that his new *UNK* , `` *CUNKER* *CUNKS* , '' had just been released , that his family was in the front row , and that it was his mother 's *UNK* , so he was going to play her favorite *UNK* from the record . STOP
He launched into *CUNKS* 's `` The *CUNK* '' from `` Carnival of the *CUNKS* , '' a favorite *UNK* piece for *UNKS* , with *UNKLY* , *UNK* tone and no *UNK* . STOP
Then , as if to show that he could play fast as well , he offered the second movement from *CUNKS* 's *CUNK* for *CUNK* , a *UNKAL* , *UNK* *UNK* that reflected the *UNK* side of the Stoltzman *UNK* . STOP
And so it went through the first half : an *UNKLY* chosen *UNK* of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would *UNK* or challenge a *UNKER* . STOP
Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , *UNKER* and an old *UNK* from Yale , and *UNK* *UNK* *CUNK* *CUNK* . STOP
An *UNKAL* section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas , beginning with `` Golden *CUNK* , '' a *UNKING* , *UNK-* lead in to the *UNK* `` *CUNK* , '' which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to *UNK* in a high *UNKER* and show off his fleet *UNKS* . STOP
*CUNK* 's `` Air '' followed . STOP
Mr. Stoltzman tied the *UNKER* in by *UNKING* him `` the great *UNKER* of the *UNK* century , '' and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some *CUNK* *UNK-* *UNKS* , *UNKLY* arranged for *UNK* and *UNK* by Mr. Douglas . STOP
*CUNKING* the mood light , the two then *UNKED* and *UNKED* their way through some *OUS* *UNKS* , *UNKED* by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to *CUNK* 's dry *UNKING* techniques , and then , with Mr. *CUNK* , soared and *UNKED* on the *UNKER* 's tight `` *CUNK* *CUNKS* . '' STOP
The end of the first half , however , brought what the *UNKLY* crowd seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer *CUNK* *CUNKS* , who appears on `` *CUNKER* *CUNKS* . '' STOP
*OUS* and *UNKED* as ever , Ms. *CUNKS* *UNK* *CUNK* Mitchell 's `` For Free '' -- about an *UNKER* with a *UNKER* *UNK* , to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a *UNK* *UNK* -- and Mr. Douglas 's *UNK* setting of a *CUNK* *UNKING* , `` *CUNK* *CUNK* . '' STOP
`` *CUNK* *CUNK* '' also featured a slide show of *UNKLY* but *UNK* images of *UNKS* , *UNKS* , *UNKS* , *UNKS* , *UNK* . STOP
It was all too *UNK* to be believed , but they probably would have gotten away with it , had they not felt *UNKED* to add Ms. *CUNKS* 's *UNK* *UNK* , `` *CUNKING* Grace , '' and ask for audience participation . STOP
That went over the *UNK* line for warm and *UNK* feelings . STOP
*CUNK* this why some of the audience *UNKED* before or during the second half ? STOP
Or was it because Ms. *CUNKS* had gone ? STOP
*CUNKER* way it was a *UNK* , because Mr. *CUNK* offered the most substantial music of the evening just after *UNKION* : Steve *CUNK* 's `` New York *CUNK* , '' one of a series of *CUNK* works that *UNK* a live *UNKER* with recorded tracks of his or her own playing . STOP
-LRB- Mr. *CUNK* 's new `` *CUNK* *CUNKS* '' for string *UNK* uses the technique *UNKLY* . -RRB- STOP
Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it : He warned us in advance that `` New York *CUNK* '' *UNKS* 11 1\/2 minutes . STOP
He also *UNKLY* *UNKED* this *UNK* , *UNK* *UNK* with Mr. *CUNK* 's images , this time of *UNK* or *UNKING* *UNKS* , in a *UNK* *UNKING* of the musical structure that was *UNKLY* *UNKING* from Mr. *CUNK* 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's *UNK* execution of it . STOP
The rest of the *UNK* was more straight *UNK* and *UNK* sounds written by *CUNK* Parker , *CUNK* *CUNK* , Bill Douglas and *CUNK* *CUNK* , with pictures for the Douglas pieces . STOP
It was *UNK* to hear *UNKED* *UNK* without having to sit in a *UNKED* club , but like the first half , much of it was easy to take and ultimately *UNK* . STOP
Is this the future of chamber music ? STOP
Managers and *UNKS* insist that chamber music *UNKS* are a hard sell , but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is *UNKED* of threatening elements , served up in *UNKED* *UNKS* and accompanied by *UNKS* ? STOP
What 's next ? STOP
*CUNKS* to *UNK* *CUNK* *UNKS* ? STOP
It was not an *UNUNK* evening , certainly , thanks to the high level of performance , the *UNKAL* *UNKS* of Mr. Douglas , and the obvious *UNK* with which Mr. Stoltzman *UNKS* his *UNKS* . STOP
But it was neither deep nor *UNKING* : light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of *CUNKS* . STOP
Ms. *CUNK* is a *UNK-* writer based in New York . STOP
One of Ronald Reagan 's *UNKS* as President was that he rarely gave his *UNKING* to the *UNK* that *UNKS* for `` consensus '' in various international institutions . STOP
In fact , he *UNKED* the U.S. from one of the world 's most *UNK* organizations -- *CUNK* . STOP
This is the U.N. group that managed to *UNK* its own charter of promoting education , science and culture . STOP
*CUNKER* since , the remaining members have been *UNK* for the United States to *UNK* this *UNK* group . STOP
Now *CUNK* *UNKS* are lobbying President Bush to *UNK* on President Reagan 's decision to *UNK* . STOP
But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the *UNK* future and well beyond . STOP
The U.S. , along with Britain and Singapore , left the agency when its *UNK-* *UNK* , financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand . STOP
The personal *UNKS* of agency Director *CUNK-* *CUNK* drew much attention , such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as *CUNK* plants and *UNKED* from France and when a *OUS* office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to *UNK* U.S. funds . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* was an extreme case , but even his replacement , the more personally *UNKAL* Spanish *UNK* *CUNK* Mayor , has had little success at *UNKING* reforms . STOP
Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means *UNK* from the West to pay for everyone else 's *UNK* . STOP
The *CUNK* `` New World Information Order '' would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be *UNKED* to *UNK* to their government , which would have *UNKING* and *UNK* powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas . STOP
*CUNK* somehow converted the *UNKING* U.N. *UNKS* of individual rights and *UNK* into `` *UNKS* ' rights . '' STOP
*CUNK-* *UNKS* were held to *UNK* on subjects such as `` *UNKAL* responsibilities of scientists in support of *UNK* '' and `` the impact of the activities of *UNKAL* corporations . '' STOP
The agency was so totally *UNKED* from the high principles of its *UNKING* that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so *UNKAL* to them . STOP
*CUNK* may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister *CUNK* Shevardnadze last year admitted , `` The *UNKED* *UNKAL* approach *UNKED* *UNK* *UNK* to *CUNK* . '' STOP
*CUNK* is now holding its *UNKAL* meetings in Paris to *UNK* its next projects . STOP
Mr. Mayor 's hope that *UNKS* to `` press freedom '' would survive *UNKED* seems *UNKED* to failure ; the current *UNKING* is `` *UNKING* the public and media to avoid *UNKION* . '' STOP
He has n't been able to replace the *CUNK* *UNKAL* . STOP
Soviets remain in charge of education programs , a former head of an African military *UNKAL* for *UNKS* is in charge of culture , and a *UNK-* Polish communist in *UNK* directs the *UNKS* and peace division . STOP
Of the agency 's *UNKN* staff members , 230 are in the field working on actual projects , such as *UNK* and *UNK* research . STOP
The position of the United States , which once contributed 25 % of the budget , is that nothing has changed . STOP
John *CUNK* , the assistant secretary of state for international organizations , told Congress that the continuing `` *UNK* , *UNK* , *UNK* '' programs make *UNKING* any time soon `` extremely unlikely . '' STOP
This has n't much *UNKED* the *CUNK* *UNKS* , who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy *UNK-* French *UNK* the agency somehow owns . STOP
Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time *UNKING* continued membership . STOP
We see an even stronger argument against *CUNK* than its *UNKING* failure to reform . STOP
This is that the Reagan *CUNKION* *UNKING* Eastern Europe and *CUNK* Square shows the power of ideas *UNKED* by international civil *UNKS* or government *UNKS* . STOP
Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get *UNKED* only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home . STOP
The *CUNKS* of the United *CUNKS* are experts at *UNKION* . STOP
This can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to *UNK* the importance and *UNK* of Western *UNKS* of freedom and justice . STOP
We can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to *UNK* *CUNK* . STOP
Researchers at Plant *CUNK* Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops . STOP
The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that *UNKS* the production of *UNK* . STOP
The gene thus can prevent a plant from *UNKING* itself . STOP
Such so-called *UNK-* plants can then be *UNKED* by *UNK* from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed . STOP
The new generation of plants will *UNKS* the *UNKING* , *UNKION* *UNK* known as `` hybrid *UNK* , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid corn . STOP
`` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said *CUNK* Robinson , president of Delta & *CUNK* Land Co. , a *CUNK* Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . STOP
On a commercial scale , the *UNKION* of the *UNKING* male part has only been achieved in corn and *UNK* feed *UNKS* . STOP
That 's because the male part , the *UNK* , and the female , the *UNK* , are some distance apart on the corn plant . STOP
In a *UNK-* process , the seed companies cut off the *UNKS* of each plant , making it male *UNK* . STOP
They *UNK* a row of *UNK-* plants nearby , which then *UNK* the *UNK-* plants . STOP
The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this *UNKAL* approach were introduced in the 1930s and they *UNKED* as much as 20 % more corn than naturally *UNKED* plants . STOP
The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies . STOP
A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , *UNKS* and rice . STOP
The male part , the *UNKS* of the plant , and the female , the *UNKS* , of the same plant are within a *UNKION* of an *UNK* or even attached to each other . STOP
The *UNKS* in these plants are difficult to *UNK* off . STOP
In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male *UNKS* of rice plants using *UNKS* , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds . STOP
At Plant *CUNK* Systems , researchers have isolated a *UNKING* gene that can be *UNKED* in a plant to *UNKER* male *UNK* . STOP
*CUNK* *CUNKS* , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in *UNKING* *UNKED* plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` *UNKER* gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . STOP
The *UNKING* gene is expressed just before the *UNK* is about to develop and it *UNKS* the *UNKS* of every *UNKER* in the plant . STOP
Mr. *CUNKS* said this genetic *UNKION* does n't hurt the growth of that plant . STOP
The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering *UNK* in order to get *UNK-* plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop . STOP
They attached a second gene , for *UNK* resistance , to the *UNKING* gene . STOP
Both genes are then *UNKED* into a few greenhouse plants , which are then *UNKED* and allowed to mature and produce seed . STOP
The laws of *UNK* *UNK* that half of the plants *UNKING* from these *UNKED* seeds will be male *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* and half will be male *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* . STOP
The application of *UNK* would kill off the *UNK-* plants , leaving a large field of *UNK-* plants that can be *UNKED* to produce hybrid seed . STOP
Mr. *CUNKS* said the hybrid *UNKS* created with this genetic engineering yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial *UNKS* used currently . STOP
`` This technique is *UNK* to a wide variety of crops , '' he said , and added that some *UNKS* may be necessary to accommodate the *UNKS* of each type of crop . STOP
He said the company is *UNKING* with the technique on *UNK* , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops . STOP
He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently *UNKED* are *UNKS* , the genetic approach will *UNK* the need for *UNKAL* *UNKION* of *UNKS* , which costs U.S. seed producers about $ 70 million annually . STOP
In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has *UNKED* research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including *CUNK* Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co . STOP
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical *UNK* supposed to kill only a plant 's *UNK* . STOP
But there have been problems with chemical *UNKS* *UNKING* plants ' female *UNK* *UNKS* and concern for the *UNK* of such chemical *UNKS* to humans , animals and beneficial *UNKS* . STOP
However , Paul *CUNK* , *CUNK* 's director of plant *UNKS* , said the company 's chemical *UNK* *UNKS* these problems and is `` *UNK* on the female *UNK* . '' STOP
*CUNK* *CUNKS* Corp. , *CUNK* , Calif. , is developing a *UNK* containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and *UNKS* with the genes that are responsible for producing *UNK* . STOP
This gene , called `` *UNK* , '' is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days . STOP
Robert *CUNK* , president of *CUNK* , called Plant *CUNK* 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` *UNK* rather than competitive . '' STOP
`` There is a large market out there *UNK* for hybrid seeds , '' he said . STOP
Mr. Robinson of Delta & *CUNK* , the seed producer in Scott , *CUNK* , said Plant *CUNK* 's success in creating *UNKLY* engineered male *UNKS* does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create *UNKS* in all crops . STOP
That 's because *UNKION* , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves *UNKS* as carriers in crops such as cotton . STOP
`` It 's one thing to say you can *UNK* , and another to then successfully *UNK* the plant , '' he said . STOP
Nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with Plant *CUNK* to acquire the technology to try *UNKING* hybrid cotton . STOP
A bitter conflict with global implications has *UNKED* between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies . STOP
The *UNK* is a sign of a new *UNKS* and *UNKS* in Japan 's *UNK-* financial circles . STOP
Not only are Japan 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they 're *UNKING* off against one another in unprecedented public fashion . STOP
Already , the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments . STOP
What triggered the latest *UNK* was a *UNK* over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue . STOP
Nomura was attempting to *UNK* the 50 *UNK-* -LRB- $ *UNKN* million -RRB- borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan , were *UNKING* the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a *UNK* investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand 's *UNK-* pension fund . STOP
*CUNKING* to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative *UNKS* in the new financing , forcing an *UNKED* Nomura to postpone it this week . STOP
The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan 's financial *UNKS* . STOP
Aside from Nomura 's injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government . STOP
*CUNKED* by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , Wellington 's *CUNK* Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars -LRB- US$ *UNKN* billion -RRB- to *CUNK* 4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30 . STOP
With Japan 's *UNK-* banks *UNKED* against it , though , raising money may be difficult . STOP
Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan , bankers here say , but as the largest underwriters in the *CUNK* market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too . STOP
New Zealand 's finance minister , David *CUNK* , *UNKED* out at such suggestions . STOP
He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to *CUNK* New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank *UNKED* by the National *CUNK* Fund , and would n't *UNK* it out . STOP
`` It may very well be what the Japanese banks want , '' he told Radio New Zealand . STOP
`` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be *UNKED* by Japanese banks or any other international interests . '' STOP
No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries . STOP
*CUNK* is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other . STOP
Both sides are *UNKLY* *UNKING* their *UNK* , and relations have been at a *UNK* for months . STOP
The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business . STOP
Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full *UNK* of competition from the banks . STOP
Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by *UNK* of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most *UNK* and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad , *UNK* the opposing sides . STOP
And their *UNKS* of each other run deep . STOP
In the past year , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses . STOP
Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed *UNKS* to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the *UNK* of banks . STOP
And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to *UNK-* institutions overseas , a move that *UNKED* the anger of the stock brokerage firms . STOP
The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions *UNK-* . STOP
*CUNK* CORP. reported third-quarter earnings , which were *UNKLY* shown in the *CUNKLY* Earnings *CUNKS* table in yesterday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates . STOP
On a pretax basis , *CUNK* 's third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share were actually *UNKN* % higher than the average of estimates . STOP

Perhaps . STOP
But for the next few months , these *UNKS* of *UNKS* long past are going to be *UNKING* in an Indian summer of the *UNK* . STOP

The average three-month issue rose to 8.05 % from *UNKN* % . STOP
*CUNKLY* , banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills , which are considered the *UNKEST* short-term investments ; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products . STOP
But when market interest rates move up rapidly , increases in bank CD yields sometimes lag . STOP
Most yields on short-term *UNK* CDs , those with denominations over $ *UNKN* , also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields . STOP
The average six-month yield on a *UNK* CD was at 7.90 % , down from *UNKN* % , Banxquote said . STOP
For *UNK-* CDs , yields were up . STOP
The average two-year and five-year *UNKS* were up *UNKN* of a percentage point to *UNKN* % and 7.96 % , respectively . STOP
However , CDs sold through major *UNKER* networks were up slightly almost across the board . STOP

The man with the *UNK* represented a *UNKED* attempt to introduce a bit of *UNK* *UNK* into our *UNK* . STOP
But as the French *UNK* a *CUNK-* state of *UNK* when it comes to *UNKS* -LRB- try finding a *CUNKS* machine in Paris -RRB- , my fellow *UNKS* were having none of it . STOP

But in *CUNKAL* , a gray *UNK-* *UNKER* town *UNK* to France 's *CUNKS* mountain region , none of these *CUNKLY* *UNKS* for things *UNK* was evident . STOP
*CUNKING* at the de *UNK* hour of 6 a.m. held all the *UNKION* for most people of *UNK* *UNKAL* work . STOP
*CUNKING* the *UNKS* of a culture *UNK* , I promptly signed up . STOP
The first thing anybody will tell you about *UNKING* is that it requires *UNK* in the way of *UNK* *UNKS* , or even a measure of *UNK-* . STOP
-LRB- So long as you do n't look down . -RRB- STOP
They will also tell you that even if you hate *UNKS* , you can still balloon . STOP
-LRB- I still say do n't look down . STOP
At least not when you are *UNKING* . -RRB- STOP
What they wo n't tell you is not to go *UNK* in anything you do n't want to get *UNK* . STOP
I 'm not referring to the traditional *UNK* *UNKING* during the *UNK-* *UNK* . STOP

When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` *UNK* car , '' listening to the *UNKER* *UNKER* into a *UNK-* . STOP
After long *UNKS* of this *UNK* ground activity came 20 or so *UNKLY* minutes of *UNKING* above the *CUNKS* watching the silver *UNKS* rise off the *UNKER* and the French *UNKS* *UNK* about the fields . STOP
It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his *UNK* with this kind of *UNK-* view of the world , even if your *UNK* in silly *UNK* *UNK* kept *UNKING* out how `` *UNK* '' it all was . STOP
Eventually little French farmers and their little French *UNKS* came out of their *UNK* houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and *UNKED* at us . STOP
No wonder . STOP
We were coming down straight into their *UNKAL* . STOP
*CUNK* , the other rule of *UNK* about *UNKING* is that you ca n't *UNKER* . STOP
And neither can your pilot . STOP
You can go only up or down -LRB- by *UNKING* the balloon 's air with a *UNK* *UNKER* , which does make the top of your head feel hot -RRB- and ride the air *UNKS* . STOP
*CUNK* makes the *UNK* car necessary . STOP
Most *UNKS* *UNK* go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a *UNKLY* *UNKN* miles an hour . STOP
When the balloon is *UNKING* along at a steady *UNK* there is little sense of motion . STOP
Only when one is *UNKING* -- or in our case *UNKING* a *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* -- does one feel , well , *UNK* in a *UNK* basket . STOP
`` What 's he doing ? '' *UNKED* my *UNKION* , who was the only other *CUNKING* member of the convention and whose *UNKS* were white . STOP

`` You bet attention , '' I *UNKED* back , *UNKING* *UNK* the *UNK* tanks , `` I 'm wearing *UNK* *UNKS* ! '' STOP
Our pilot simply *UNKED* , fired up the *UNKER* and with another *UNK* of *UNK* lifted us , *UNK* , a good *UNKS* above the water level . STOP
We *UNKED* along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again . STOP
Eventually we came to rest in a *UNK* *UNK* of field where we had the *UNK* *UNK* of *UNKING* out of the basket into the *UNK* while the French half of our *UNKING* *UNK* team scrambled in . STOP
I looked at my watch . STOP
*CUNKLY* *UNK-* *UNK* . STOP
Back in the *UNK* car , we drove around some more , got stuck in a *UNK* , *UNKED* the aid of a local farmer to get out the *UNKER* *UNK* and pull us out of the *UNK* . STOP
We finally *UNKED* with our balloon , which had come to rest on a *UNK* road amid a *UNK* of *CUNKS* who watched us *UNK* our *UNK* -- another *UNK-* of *UNK-* activity -- that included the *UNKION* routine of *UNKING* the balloon to the ground , *UNKING* all the air out of it , rolling it up and *UNKING* it and the basket into the *UNKER* . STOP
It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the *UNKEST* *UNKING* hole . STOP
This meant returning to the golf course , where we watched a few French *UNKS* *UNK* the first *UNK* while we sat under *CUNK* *UNKS* , me *UNKING* an *UNK* and my *UNK* . STOP
A whole morning of *UNKING* and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes . STOP
Still , I figured the event 's *UNK-* back in the *CUNK* was near *UNKS* . STOP
As for the ride back to *UNK* , our pilot and all the other *CUNKING* passengers *UNKED* into the *UNK* car . STOP
My American *UNKION* and I were left to ride *UNK* in the *UNKER* basket . STOP

Treasury *CUNK* David *CUNK* defended the Treasury 's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar , saying it helped *UNK* damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market Oct. 13 . STOP
*CUNKING* before a House subcommittee , Mr. *CUNK* said that if the Treasury had n't *UNKED* in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock market might have *UNKED* a steep fall in the currency that might have `` *UNKED* financial markets .

Mr. *CUNK* , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . '' STOP

Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , who had *UNKED* from the Treasury 's policy , told lawmakers , `` I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market . '' STOP
*CUNKION* , he added , is useful only to smooth *UNKLY* markets , not to *UNKLY* influence the dollar 's value . STOP
Rep. John *CUNK* -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said Mr. Johnson refused to testify jointly with Mr. *CUNK* and instead asked to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony . STOP
A Fed spokesman denied Mr. *CUNK* 's statement . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* said reports of tension between the Treasury and Fed have been *UNKED* , insisting that they involved `` *UNKS* . '' STOP
Mr. Johnson also said that `` in the scheme of things , these things are minor . '' STOP
On other matters , Mr. *CUNK* said West Germany is contributing to *UNKS* in the world economy because of its success as an *UNKER* . STOP
`` The solution is stronger domestic growth -LCB- in Germany -RCB- , '' he said . STOP
But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than expected , Mr. *CUNK* said , it 's difficult for the U.S. to argue that Germany ought to adopt more *UNK* monetary and fiscal policies . STOP
Germany 's trade surplus is largely with other European countries rather than with the U.S. , Mr. *CUNK* acknowledged . STOP
But nonetheless U.S. companies might be more successful in European markets if not for the German export push , he said . STOP
Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors : E. *CUNK* *CUNKS* III , a *UNK-* managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department ; Michael R. *CUNK* , 44 , a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions ; Richard *CUNK* , 53 , a general partner who heads the *UNK* clearing services ; Michael *CUNKS* , 46 , a general partner who is treasurer ; and William J. *CUNKS* , 42 , a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer .

Some U.S. allies are *UNKING* that President Bush is pushing *UNKS* talks too quickly , creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years . STOP
*CUNKS* about the pace of the *CUNK* talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons , as well as major reductions and *UNKS* of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon . STOP
Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest . STOP
But some American defense officials believe the North Atlantic *CUNK* Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered . STOP
For one thing , Pentagon officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time *UNKING* Europeans to keep some *UNK-* nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet *UNKED* forces are *UNKED* out . STOP
At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a *UNKAL* force of nuclear weapons in Europe . STOP
*CUNKS* concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex *UNK-* talks ever attempted . STOP
So far , no ally has complained openly , *UNKING* the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . STOP
But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still *UNKING* over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? '' STOP
Five of the six categories of weapons under *UNKION* have n't even been defined . STOP
*CUNKS* currently are defined as *UNKED* vehicles *UNKING* 25 tons or more that carry large *UNKS* . STOP
The Soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks , which are as light as 10 tons . STOP
*CUNK* A. *CUNK* , the chief Soviet *UNK* in the *UNKS* talks , argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some *UNKN* tanks , while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe . STOP
But the issue is *UNKER* than it seems . STOP
France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks . STOP
And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet *UNKION* is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing *UNKER* , more *UNK* , *UNK-* tanks . STOP
*CUNKING* combat aircraft is even tougher . STOP
The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for *UNKING* some 4,000 Russian planes because they are `` solely defensive . '' STOP
NATO has n't *UNKED* from its *UNK* that any *UNKING* plane has offensive capability . STOP
The dispute over that issue , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty *UNKER* , '' and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it . STOP
Accounting problems raise more *UNK* issues . STOP
Greece and Turkey , for example , are *UNKED* of *UNKING* their *UNKS* in hopes that they can emerge from the *UNKION* treaty with large remaining forces to *UNKER* each other . STOP
Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own *UNKS* . STOP
`` It 's just going to be *UNK* , both on our side and theirs -LCB- the Warsaw *CUNK* 's -RCB- , '' says one NATO analyst . STOP
So far , neither the Bush administration nor *UNK-* experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to *UNK* out than President Bush has allowed . STOP
They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current *UNK* attitude . STOP
`` So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere ? '' asks Rep. Norman *CUNKS* -LRB- D. , Wash. -RRB- , a member of the House group that visited the talks in *CUNK* . STOP
`` The bottom line is that if we can get that -LCB- Warsaw *CUNK* -RCB- *UNK* brought down to parity , we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible . STOP
I worry more about things becoming so *UNKED* on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate . STOP
International *CUNK* Finance Corp. announced a leasing contract with charter carrier American Trans Air Inc. , in a transaction involving six Boeing Co. *UNKS* . STOP
The value of the *UNKS* , including *UNKS* , is in excess of $ 250 million . STOP
Two of the *UNKS* are new aircraft to be delivered to American Trans Air , the main subsidiary of *CUNK* Inc. , in December 1991 and January 1992 . STOP
Four of the planes were purchased by International *CUNK* from Singapore Airlines in a previously announced transaction . STOP

Coca-Cola Co. , *UNKING* to boost soft-drink volume in Singapore , said it is discussing a joint venture with *CUNKER* & *CUNK* Ltd. , its *UNKING* franchisee in that country . STOP
The venture would be the latest in Coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment . STOP
So far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into *UNKING* operations in Australia , New Zealand and France . STOP
The move also reflects Coke 's *UNKS* to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific *CUNK* countries . STOP
Aside from Europe , the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come . STOP
That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and *UNK* gold mine . STOP
In countries such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft *UNKS* . STOP
And unlike Europe and the U.S. , where *UNKS* are aging , the Pacific *CUNK* countries have growing *UNKS* of *UNKS* -- the *UNKEST* consumers of Coca-Cola and other *UNKS* . STOP
A Coca-Cola spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured , or how much the company would invest in the transaction . STOP
In the past , however , Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures . STOP
By acquiring stakes in *UNKING* companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve *UNKS* ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing . STOP
Coke has *UNKED* to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country . STOP
That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market . STOP
In Singapore , *UNK-* consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. . STOP
And combining *CUNKER* & *CUNK* 's own soft *UNKS* with Coca-Cola 's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the *UNK* market there , Coke said . STOP
*CUNKER* & *CUNK* , which also has interests in packaging , beer and *UNK* products , holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and *CUNK* , where *UNK-* consumption is n't as high as in Singapore . STOP
Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the *UNKED* potential in those markets . STOP
A Coke spokesman said he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks . STOP
Coke said the *UNK-* arrangement , which needs approval from both companies ' boards , should be completed early next year . STOP
*CUNK* *CUNK* Inc. , Old Greenwich , Conn. , said it increased its quarterly 11 % to 68 cents a share from 61 cents , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 . STOP
The increase follows the company 's report of strong earnings for the third quarter , and reflects what American Brands called its `` tradition of *UNKING* earnings growth '' with shareholders . STOP
American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco , *UNKED* spirits and life insurance . STOP
As of Sept. 30 , American Brands had *UNKN* million shares outstanding . STOP
Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its *UNK* control of Fiat *CUNK* . A. and will admit Prince *CUNK* *CUNK* *CUNK* as its first *UNKLY* shareholder . STOP

The company said *CUNK* *CUNK* Agnelli *CUNK* , sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , agreed to trade her shares in *CUNK* for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership , which will give her control of *UNKN* % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co . STOP
The *CUNK* *CUNK* , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in *CUNKED* *CUNK* S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for *UNKN* % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital . STOP
His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders *UNKS* . STOP
The *CUNK* *CUNK* owns 10 % of *CUNK* 's capital , while *CUNK* owns 23 % . STOP
As a result of the transaction , which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24 , Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control *UNKN* % of *CUNK* 's ordinary shares . STOP
Its capital will also be raised to *UNKN* billion lire -LRB- $ *UNKN* million -RRB- from the current *UNKN* billion lire . STOP
*CUNK* also has *UNKING* preferred shares , which are quoted on the Milan stock exchange . STOP
The value of the two transactions was n't disclosed , but an *CUNK* spokesman said no cash would change hands . STOP
The move *UNKS* the existing links between the *CUNKS* and the *CUNK* *CUNK* , the head of the world 's *CUNK* *CUNKS* who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes *UNKING* with Mr. Agnelli . STOP
Mr. Agnelli and the *CUNK* *CUNK* also have some business ties , and a spokesman for the Agnelli company did n't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further *UNKION* . STOP
For instance , *CUNK* earlier this year bought an 18 % stake in *CUNK* , the *CUNK* *CUNK* 's airline , which *UNKS* between Italy and *CUNK* . STOP
Giovanni Agnelli & Co. , which was formed in January 1987 as a way of keeping the *CUNKS* ' controlling stake in Fiat together despite an *UNKING* family *UNK* , has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late . STOP

Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed on a compromise *UNK-* bill , opening the way for the first *UNK-* boost in more than nine years . STOP
The agreement ended a long *UNK* between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue . STOP
President Bush in June *UNKED* a measure passed by Congress and said he would n't accept any *UNK-* rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue . STOP
The compromise was a somewhat *UNKED* version of what the White House had said it would accept . STOP
Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders , the minimum wage would rise from the current $ *UNKN* an hour to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 . STOP
*CUNKS* could also pay a *UNK* `` training wage '' for 90 days to new workers who are up to 19 years old , and then for another 90 days if the company *UNKS* a specific training program for the *UNKS* . STOP
White House officials were *UNKED* that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage , which Mr. Bush has fought for throughout the year . STOP
`` For the first time in history , we have a training wage that will be part '' of the nation 's labor laws , said Roger *CUNKER* , assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy . STOP
White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage , the final *UNK-* increase will meet the standards set by Mr. Bush . STOP
The bill *UNKED* by the president in June , which the House failed to override , would have lifted the minimum wage to $ *UNKN* an hour by late 1991 , with a training wage for up to two months , generally for a worker 's first job . STOP
Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , *UNKED* with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . STOP
Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training *UNK* would be *UNKER* , unless it is tied to a training plan . STOP
Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage , while new workers need far less than six months to be *UNKED* for their jobs . STOP
Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately . STOP
With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a *UNK-* rise for *UNK-* workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit *UNKER* taxpayers . STOP
Republicans have been *UNKING* the White House to compromise on the wage issue . STOP

STOP
The House is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise , as a substitute to a new Democratic bill , itself *UNKED* down from last spring 's version . STOP
The Senate will probably vote not long *UNK* . STOP
Some Democrats thought they might have *UNKED* too much . STOP
Rep. Austin Murphy -LRB- D. , Pa. -RRB- , chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee , said they might have done better `` if we 'd held their feet to the fire . '' STOP
Mr. Kennedy suggested Democrats `` *UNKED* a great deal '' on the size of the increase , but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage , which he said make it `` less *UNK* . '' STOP

Armstrong World Industries Inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to *CUNK* Industries Inc . STOP
The price was n't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $ 150 million . STOP
Armstrong , which has faced a takeover threat from the *CUNK* family of Canada since July , said that *UNKING* of the carpet business would improve `` total financial performance . '' STOP
The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses , which include *UNK* *UNK* , floor *UNKS* and furniture . STOP
Moreover , such a sale could help Armstrong *UNK* its investors and *UNKER* the *CUNKS* , who own a *UNKN* % stake in the *CUNKER* , Pa. , company . STOP
Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition . STOP
The carpet division had 1988 sales of $ *UNKN* million , or almost 14 % of Armstrong 's $ *UNKN* billion total revenue . STOP
The company has been manufacturing carpet since *UNKN* . STOP
Recently it *UNKED* its plants so that it could make *UNK-* products with higher quality *UNKS* . STOP
For the past year or two , the carpet division 's operating profit margins have *UNKED* around 5 % , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared with the 13 % to 19 % margins for two of Armstrong 's chief businesses , *UNKING* and building products . STOP
Analysts *UNKED* the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and *CUNK* , the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry , with an estimated 17 % to 20 % share . STOP
*CUNK* , based in *CUNK* , *CUNK* , has annual sales of about $ *UNKN* billion , and has economies of scale and lower *UNKAL* costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands , sold under the Armstrong and *CUNK-* names . STOP
Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , *CUNK* 's shares closed *UNK-* at $ *UNKN* , up $ 2.25 . STOP
Armstrong 's shares , also listed on the Big Board , closed at $ *UNKN* , up 12.5 cents . STOP
Yesterday , Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months , *UNKED* by the stock *UNKION* of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year . STOP
For the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents a share , including a one-time gain of $ 5.9 million . STOP
In the year-ago quarter , earnings were $ *UNKN* million , or 93 cents a share . STOP
Yesterday , Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small *CUNKED* *CUNK* Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company , *CUNK* *CUNK* Ltd . STOP

Armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late November and the carpet sale in December , with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or *UNKER* results . STOP
The government 's primary *UNKING* gauge rose a slight 0.2 % in September , but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing . STOP
The small increase in the index of leading indicators , which had climbed 0.5 % in August but was unchanged in July , does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed *UNKLY* . STOP
However , it does n't give much of a *UNK* as to whether a recession is on the *UNK* . STOP
`` I do n't think it provides much new information on the economy , '' said Richard *CUNK* , economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . STOP
So far this year , the index of leading indicators has risen in four months , fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month . STOP
In another report yesterday , the Commerce Department said sales of new *UNKLY* houses plunged 14 % in September to an annual rate of *UNKN* from *UNKN* in August . STOP
The declines were particularly *UNKED* in the Northeast and in the South , where Hurricane Hugo was a factor . STOP
Although September 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales , the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market . STOP
The September drop was the largest since a 19 % drop in January 1982 , but monthly changes in this measure are even less *UNK* than those in other economic indicators . STOP
Because the figures are based on a small *UNK* , the department said it is 90 % confident only that *UNK-* sales fell somewhere between 5 % and 23 % during the month . STOP
The department also said it takes four months to establish a trend . STOP
So far this year , *UNKN* newly built homes have been sold , down 4.5 % from the like months of 1988 . STOP
The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan . STOP
This measure had dropped sharply in August . STOP
The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to *UNK* the index , the influence of this component has been reduced . STOP
Of the 11 components to the index , only three others rose in September : the money supply , the length of the average work week and stock prices . STOP
Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September . STOP
These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on *UNK* *UNKS* , orders for new plant and equipment , and *UNKS* of orders for durable goods . STOP
Meanwhile , the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61 % do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later . STOP
The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in STOP
Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates , 60 % of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep *UNKING* as its top priority even if that means higher rates . STOP
The other 40 % said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down . STOP
All the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns . STOP
Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators . STOP
After various adjustments , they produced a 0.5 % rise in the index for August and a 0.2 % rise for September . STOP
September , and the change from August , are : from *UNKN* in the previous month . STOP
Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $ 60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter . STOP
The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities . STOP
As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled *CUNK* *CUNK* Power *CUNKION* to that plant 's performance . STOP
In its order , the state regulatory agency said the company `` must be held *UNK* for the mistakes made in the management of the plant 's operation . '' STOP

An *UNK* *UNK* writing a *UNKER* about *UNK* *UNKING* might *UNK* a *CUNK* Stoll , but it 's unlikely . STOP
It 's also unnecessary . STOP
*CUNK* *UNKER* *CUNK* Stoll is a real person , or as he might *UNKLY* put it , a *UNKAL* person . STOP
He is 37 , an *UNKER* with impressive credentials , and something of a *UNKS* at making computers do his bidding . STOP
He once described himself as a `` Berkeley *CUNK* , '' and played the role well ; *UNK* *UNKED* *UNKS* , a *UNK* of long hair and rejection of all things conventional , including , for a time at least , formal marriage to his `` *UNK* , '' *CUNK* *CUNKS* . STOP
He also is an *UNKING* writer , combining *UNKS* and *UNK* with *UNK* detail and *UNK* *UNKS* of how computers work . STOP
In `` The *CUNK* 's Egg '' -LRB- *CUNK* , *UNKN* pages , $ *UNKN* -RRB- , he *UNKS* a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy . STOP
The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans , accused of *UNKING* information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet *CUNK* . STOP
One of them , *UNK-* *CUNKS* Hess of *CUNKER* , allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 *UNK-* computers in the U.S. , *UNKING* for *UNKS* . STOP
He probably did n't *UNK* any *UNK-* files , but the *CUNK* in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates , Peter Carl and *CUNK* *CUNK* , $ 15,000 for some of the material Hess *UNKED* . STOP
They promised yet more for really good stuff . STOP
Mr. Stoll *UNKS* his title from the *UNK* 's *UNK* of *UNKING* eggs in the *UNKS* of other *UNKS* , making them *UNK* parents . STOP
The computer spy had discovered that a popular *UNK* mail program called *CUNKS* could do *UNKS* with the widely used *CUNK* operating system created by AT&T . STOP
Using *CUNKS* , the spy could substitute a *UNKS* `` *UNK* '' program for the one that routinely *UNKS* up the *CUNK* system every five minutes . STOP
Once his *UNK* 's egg was laid , he could enter *CUNK* and become a `` *UNKER* , '' with access to everything . STOP
Mr. Stoll was *UNKING* the *UNKS* at the *CUNK* *UNK* of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the *UNK* 's computers . STOP
He discovered a *UNK-* *UNK* in the charges made to various departments for computer time and *UNKED* it to a user named `` *CUNKER* , '' who had no valid billing address . STOP
Mr. Stoll *UNKED* the *UNKER* was one of those *OUS* students who has fun breaking into computers . STOP
But after much tracking , it became evident to Mr. Stoll , through various *UNKS* , that the *UNKER* was not on the Berkeley *UNKS* or even in California . STOP
*CUNKING* him became an *UNKION* for Mr. Stoll . STOP
He made a midnight *UNKION* of all the *UNKS* he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the *UNK* 's computers . STOP
After *UNKING* that the *UNKER* had taken over the *UNK* account of a legitimate user named Joe *CUNK* , he *UNKED* up an *UNK* system , including a portable *UNKER* , to alert him when *CUNK* came on the line . STOP
Some nights he *UNK* under his desk . STOP
His boss complained about *UNK* of other *UNKS* . STOP
The *UNKER* was *UNKING* over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily *UNK* computers as *UNKING* *UNKS* to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies . STOP
The White *CUNKS* missile range and CIA contractor *CUNK* Inc. were among the targets . STOP
When the *UNKER* moved , Mr. Stoll moved too , calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid *UNKING* *UNKION* . STOP
Sometimes , if the *UNKER* seemed to be into a sensitive file , he would drag his *UNK* across the terminal to create *UNK* or slow the system down to *UNK* his *UNK* . STOP
The FBI initially showed little interest , and he had the impression other federal security agencies were *UNKED* up in legal red tape . STOP
The CIA told him it does not do domestic *UNK* . STOP
One *UNKS* a lot from this book , or seems to , about *UNKING* federal bureaucracy . STOP
`` *CUNKS* to '' because it 's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll . STOP
Finally , he got help . STOP
*CUNK* is a major network linking computers . STOP
One of its international specialists , Steve White , took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll 's *UNK* , ultimately *UNKING* the *UNKER* to West Germany . STOP
The West Germans then took over and finally found *CUNKS* Hess . STOP
Eventually , Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and *CUNK* to brief *UNKING* officers on computer theft . STOP
He *UNKED* the *UNK* of his *UNKED* appearance among these *UNK-* *UNKS* . STOP
Back in Berkeley , he was *UNKLY* *UNKED* by a *UNKING* *UNK* friend for *UNKING* with such people . STOP
He became angry in return . STOP
He had developed a *UNKED* for the *UNKER* and a *UNKING* appreciation of the federal `` *UNKS* '' who make national security their business . STOP

Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new *UNK-* computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp . STOP
The closely held Sunnyvale , Calif. , company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp. , which will sell Mips machines under its own label . STOP
The new Mips machine , called the *CUNK* , will cost $ 150,000 for a basic system . STOP
The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several *UNKS* . STOP
The machine employs reduced *UNK-* computing , or *CUNK* , technology . STOP
At that price , an analyst familiar with the machine said , the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines . STOP
`` In the price range it 's a *UNKLY* *UNKING* product , '' said *CUNK* *CUNK* , an analyst at the *UNK-* firm *CUNK* . STOP
The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of *UNK-* technology . STOP
Mips also wants to *UNK* into markets other than traditional *CUNK* applications such as engineering ; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications . STOP
`` This clearly *UNKS* that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company , '' said Mips Vice President John *CUNK* . STOP
The Control Data deal is a *UNK* for Mips because it gives the the *UNK-* company one more ally as it *UNKS* more established electronic concerns such as Sun , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for *CUNK* machines . STOP
*CUNK* technology *UNKS* up a computer by *UNKING* the internal software . STOP
For Mips , which expects revenue of $ 100 million this year , *UNK-* allies such as Control Data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's *CUNK* architecture . STOP
`` The thing it says about Mips is that they 're on a roll right now , '' said Ms. *CUNK* at *CUNK* . STOP
`` They 're getting some major wins , '' she added . STOP
Last month , for example , Mips agreed to supply its computers to *CUNK* Computer AG of West Germany and France 's *CUNK* *CUNK* . STOP
Sony Corp. , *CUNK* Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell *CUNK* computers and companies such as Japan 's NEC Corp. and West Germany 's *CUNKS* *CUNK* have agreed to make Mips chips under license . STOP
Today 's agreement gives Control Data a machine to compete against Digital and other *UNK-* computer makers , said John *CUNK* , a *UNK-* analyst at *CUNK* Group Inc. of Boston . STOP
The machine is essentially a mainframe computer , he said . STOP
`` *CUNKLY* *CUNK* -LRB- Control Data -RRB- has a competitive product to fight back against the *CUNK* , '' a machine Digital announced last month , he added . STOP
Control Data , based in Minneapolis , *CUNK* , expects its sales of Mips systems , including the new *CUNK* , to amount to more than $ 100 million by the end of 1991 , Mips said . STOP
*CUNK* , *CUNK* and others will also sell versions of the machine , said Mips President Robert Miller . STOP
Mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990 , he said . STOP
The machine uses a single *UNK* , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several *UNKS* . STOP
The computer can process *UNKN* million calculations called *UNK-* operations every second . STOP
The machine can run software written for other Mips computers , the company said . STOP
Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit . STOP
In a hearing before the House *CUNKS* and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget . STOP
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout . STOP
Instead , the *CUNK* and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to *UNK* by Congress . STOP
The spending could be *UNKED* from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law . STOP
The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working capital . STOP
The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold . STOP
The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85 % of the value of the assets it holds . STOP
But higher interest rates paid on *UNK-* debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , *CUNKS* and Means members argued . STOP
`` To allow this massive level of *UNKED* federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said Rep. *CUNK* *CUNK* -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC 's authority to issue debt . STOP
The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years . STOP
The new S&L bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick *CUNKS* and their assets , but that is a net cost . STOP
In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold . STOP
Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets . STOP
David *CUNKS* , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions . STOP
He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` *UNK* '' the budget process by requiring either *UNKS* from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . STOP
But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said . STOP
`` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow -LCB- S&L sales -RCB- or dump acquired assets through fire sales . STOP
*CUNK* Eastern Corp. said it applied , on behalf of two of its subsidiaries , to the Federal Energy *CUNK* Commission for permission to build a *UNK-* , $ *UNKN* million pipeline system from *CUNK* County , *CUNK* , to *CUNK* , Miss . STOP
The natural gas pipeline concern said the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two *CUNK* Eastern units - Texas Eastern *CUNKION* Corp. and *CUNK* Gas Co . STOP
Texas Eastern *CUNKION* will build and operate the system , which will *UNK* the *CUNK* *CUNK* with several interstate *UNKS* . STOP
Now was that a quarter *UNK* or a half *UNK* ? STOP
Not a *UNKING* question , unless you 're the *UNK* *UNK* of this city 's *CUNK* *CUNK* restaurant and you 've just lost your *UNKS* personal *UNK* *UNK* . STOP

The *UNKED* black *UNKER* , *UNKING* with 18 years ' worth of *UNKS* held together by *UNKER* *UNKS* , was in *UNK* *CUNK* *CUNK* 's *UNK* when it was stolen from her house recently . STOP
The Berkeley police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a *UNKION* for *UNKS* . STOP
Instead , they figure the *UNK* probably took money from Ms. *CUNK* 's *UNK* and *UNKED* all the *UNKS* in the *UNK-* *UNK* . STOP
*CUNK* *CUNK* , whose founder , *CUNK* *CUNKS* , is considered the *UNK* of the *UNKING* style known as California *UNK* and whose *UNKS* make *UNKS* a month in advance , has n't exactly *UNKED* *UNKS* to *UNK* ice *UNK* because of the theft . STOP
For one thing , Ms. *CUNK* can draw on her *UNK* , published by *CUNK* House four years ago , which is *UNKING* with *UNKS* for such *UNKS* as *UNK* *UNK* , *UNK* *UNK* -LRB- a *UNK* *UNK* made with *UNKED* *UNKED* *UNKS* -RRB- and *UNK* `` *UNKS* a la *UNK* . '' STOP
For another , *UNK* fans have sent Ms. *CUNK* copies of her *UNKS* *UNKED* from magazines over the years . STOP
Still , the restaurant 's *UNKING* *UNK* of *UNK-* *UNKS* -- it *UNKLY* has n't repeated a *UNKAL* since opening in 1971 -- requires constant *UNKION* . STOP
And that puts added pressure on *CUNK* *CUNK* *UNK-* planners . STOP
`` We make what we know how to make , '' says business manager Richard *CUNK* . STOP
Many in the Bay Area 's *UNK* community *UNKS* *UNK* that Ms. *CUNK* kept only one copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from Baker 's Dozen , a group of California *UNK* *UNKS* that *UNKS* regularly to discuss issues like how to keep *UNKS* from *UNKING* and how *UNK* eating *UNKS* affect *UNKER* *UNK* .

Healthcare International Inc. said it reached a *UNK-* *UNK* agreement with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $ 5 million right away and additional amounts in the future . STOP
Under the agreement , Healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said it would pay HealthVest $ 3.9 million in *UNK* rent and mortgage payments and repay $ 1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities . STOP
In return , HealthVest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and *UNKS* against Healthcare during the *UNK-* period . STOP
After the payment , Healthcare still will be $ 6.5 million in *UNKS* on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare . STOP
Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12 % note for that *UNK* amount , to be repaid over three years . STOP
In addition , Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ 2.7 million to $ 3 million to HealthVest during the *UNK* period , to be paid when Healthcare successfully *UNKS* asset sales . STOP
Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $ 4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note . STOP
The funds should help ease a cash *UNK* at HealthVest , which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July . STOP
A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank . STOP
Healthcare , which has been in a severe liquidity *UNK* , said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with *CUNK* *CUNKION* Group Inc. in which *CUNK* purchased stock and warrants for $ 500,000 and *UNKED* Healthcare $ 9 million . STOP
The loan is backed by Healthcare 's 5.4 % stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities . STOP
I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 *CUNKAL* Journal item recognized the *UNK-* concept as one of the significant events of the past century . STOP
*CUNKLY* , about two years ago , the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the *UNK* century . STOP
But the Reserve Fund , America 's first money fund , was not named , nor were the *UNKS* of the *UNK-* concept , Harry Brown and myself . STOP
We *UNKED* telephone *UNKS* , daily dividends , total *UNKION* of share certificates and the constant $ 1 *UNK* pricing , all of which were *UNKLY* thought out and not the result of some *UNK* on the part of the SEC . STOP

The *UNKING* moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as 300 local and state *UNKS* *UNKED* into his *UNK* , *UNKED* courtroom here last year for his *UNKING* in as President Judge of Cambria County . STOP
*CUNKS* of *UNKS* and *UNKED* *UNKS* *UNKED* his bench . STOP
The local American *CUNKION* color guard led the way . STOP
As the judge *UNKED* down the center *UNK* in his *UNKING* black *UNK* , he was *UNKED* by a *UNK* *UNK* . STOP
To many , it was a *UNK* more *UNKING* a king than a rural judge *UNKED* in the isolated *UNKS* of the southern *CUNK* *CUNKS* . STOP
But then Judge O'Kicki often *UNKED* like a man who would be king -- and , some say , an *UNK* and *UNK* one . STOP
While his case may be extreme , it reflects the *UNK* of many small communities to *UNKING* judges . STOP
Last March , nine months after the judge 's *UNK-* , the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges *UNKING* more than 10 years of `` official *UNKION* '' in Cambria County , a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania . STOP
The allegations , ranging from theft and *UNK* to *UNKION* and *UNKS* , *UNK* a *UNKING* picture . STOP
According to testimony in a public , *UNK-* *UNK-* report handed up to the state attorney general , Judge O'Kicki *UNKED* cash from lawyers , *UNKED* favorable loans from banks and *UNKED* local businesses for more than a decade . STOP
*CUNKS* , in an indictment based on the grand jury 's report , maintain that at various times since 1975 , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer *UNK* ; *UNKED* hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set up a *UNK* corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former *UNK* -LRB- now his second wife -RRB- ; and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in Cambria County . STOP
In testimony recorded in the grand jury report , court employees said the judge , now 59 years old , *UNKED* his *UNKS* , made *UNKAL* demands on his staff and *UNKED* anyone who *UNKED* him . STOP
*CUNKS* claimed they were required to *UNK* him to and from work , *UNK* his lawn , *UNK* his wood , *UNK* his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown *UNKS* , *CUNK* and *CUNK* . STOP
One former *UNK* charged that the judge *UNKED* him by *UNKING* on a promise of a better paying job after *UNKING* a $ 500 *UNK* . STOP
Some of the allegations are simply *UNK* . STOP
Two former *UNKS* told the grand jury they were *UNKED* to the judge 's *UNKS* on separate occasions to take *UNKION* , only to find the judge in his *UNK* *UNUNK* . STOP
One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all . STOP
The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this week , *UNKLY* denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` *OUS* '' and `` *UNK* , political *UNK* . '' STOP
He *UNKS* the indictment on local political *UNKING* , *UNKS* with his aggressive efforts to clear the *UNK* 's *UNK* and a *UNK* by state investigators and prosecutors *UNKED* by some of his *UNKS* against them . STOP
`` I do n't know whose *UNKS* I 've stepped on , '' says the judge . STOP
`` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police *UNKS* into action . '' STOP
Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide *UNK* testimony to the *UNK* power of judges in rural communities . STOP
That power can sometimes be *UNKED* , particularly since *UNKS* in smaller *UNKS* operate without many of the *UNKS* that serve as *UNK* measures in urban areas . STOP
Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country *UNK* can expect to appear before the same judge year after year . STOP
*CUNK* of *UNKING* that judge is *UNK* , says *CUNK* *CUNKER* , founder and director of the *CUNKAL* Justice Center in *CUNKER* , *CUNK* , a public interest group that *UNKS* rural justice issues . STOP
As a result , says Mr. *CUNKER* , lawyers think twice before *UNKING* a judge 's ruling , are reluctant to mount , or even support , challenges against him for *UNKION* and are usually *UNK* to file complaints that might *UNK* a judge 's integrity . STOP
Judge O'Kicki , a *UNK* and *UNKING* man , has been a *UNK* in the local legal community for more than two decades . STOP
The son of an *UNK* *UNK* of *CUNK* *UNK* , he was raised in a small borough outside *CUNK* , the Cambria County seat , and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School . STOP
He *UNKED* near the top of his class , serving on the school law review with Richard *CUNK* , who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and , now , U.S. Attorney General . STOP
It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters . STOP
He *UNKED* his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court *UNK* . STOP
Last year , Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. *CUNK* called Mr. O'Kicki one of the *UNKEST* judges `` not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States . '' STOP
Clearly , the judge has had his share of *UNKS* . STOP
After *UNKING* law *UNKLY* , he was elected to his first 10-year term as judge in 1971 ; in 1981 , he was effectively *UNKED* . STOP
*CUNK* years ago , Judge O'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State *CUNKAL* *CUNKS* by the state 's 400 judges . STOP
He has been considered several times for *UNKS* to federal district and appellate court *UNKS* in Pennsylvania . STOP
And when he ran *UNKLY* for a state appellate court seat in 1983 , the Pennsylvania *CUNK* Association rated him `` one of the best available , '' after *UNKING* local lawyers . STOP
`` He probably was the *UNKEST* guy who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former president of Cambria County 's *UNKER* bar association , who , like most lawyers in Cambria County , *UNKS* to talk about the judge publicly . STOP
`` He 's sharp as a *UNK* . STOP
He could *UNK* an issue with the *UNK* of an eye . '' STOP
For more than a decade , virtually no one complained about Judge O'Kicki . STOP
`` What about those institutions that are supposed to be the *UNK* of society , the banks and the bar association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for the *CUNK-* , a newspaper in nearby *CUNK* , shortly after the scandal became public . STOP
`` If only a banker or a lawyer had *UNK* out years ago , the judicial process would n't be under the *UNK* it is today . '' STOP
Officials with the Pennsylvania *CUNKAL* *CUNK* and Review Board , the arm of the state that *UNKS* judicial *UNK* , counter that they had no *UNKING* of anything *UNKS* in *CUNK* . STOP
`` Nobody told us ; nobody called us , '' says an official close to the case who asked not to be named . STOP
`` Nobody had the *UNKS* to complain . '' STOP
*CUNKLY* not the lawyers . STOP
*CUNK* attorney Richard J. Green Jr. *UNKED* out $ 500 in loans to the judge over five years , he said in testimony to the grand jury . STOP
`` The judge never made a *UNK* of *UNKING* the money , '' said Mr. Green . STOP
Eventually , Mr. Green testified , he began *UNKING* out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited . STOP
When Mr. Green won a $ *UNKN* verdict in a land *UNKION* case against the state in June 1983 , he says Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $ 100,000 . STOP
Mr. Green thought little of it , he told the grand jury , until the judge *UNKED* up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a *UNK* . STOP
`` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or part of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. Green said the judge asked him . STOP
*CUNKED* , Mr. Green never paid the money , he testified . STOP
But he did n't complain to the state 's *CUNKAL* *CUNK* and Review Board , either , saying later that he feared *UNKION* . STOP
Mr. O'Kicki said he will respond to Mr. Green 's *UNKION* at his trial . STOP
Like most of Cambria County 's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge , Mr. Green declined to be interviewed for this article . STOP
And no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be *UNKED* . STOP
`` I do n't have anything much to say , and I think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here , '' says local attorney Edward F. *CUNK* . STOP
Says another lawyer : `` The practice of law is a matter of *UNKING* one 's *UNK* when you live in a small community . STOP
One had best not dance on top of a *UNK* until the *UNK* is *UNKED* *UNKLY* shut . '' STOP
The judge was considered *OUS* , *UNK* and ambitious , those who *UNKED* before him say . STOP
He *UNKED* tea sweetened with *UNK* from his *UNKED* *UNKER* chair at his bench , while *UNKING* notes ordering *UNKS* to stop *UNKING* or to take off their hats in his courtroom . STOP
Four years ago , he *UNKED* all nine members of the Cambria County School Board for several hours after they *UNKED* his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers ' strike . STOP
*CUNKS* in his *UNKS* say he could *UNK* *UNKLY* the years , months , weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the *UNKING* president judge , giving Judge O'Kicki the *UNK* required to take over as the *UNK* 's top court *UNK* . STOP
The judge , they say , was fiercely *UNK* of his *UNKS* and *UNKS* . STOP
`` My name is judge , '' Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in *CUNK* when he bought a new red *CUNK* *CUNK* in October 1984 , according to the *UNK-* report . STOP
The dealership *UNKLY* recorded the sale under the name `` Judge O'Kicki . '' STOP
Yet , despite the judge 's *UNKAL* *UNKING* , no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing , says John *CUNK* , president of Cambria County 's *UNKER* bar association . STOP
`` The *UNK* of a judge , his *UNK* , the way he *UNKS* people are not a basis for filing a complaint , '' says Mr. *CUNK* . STOP
`` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' STOP
State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in Cambria County . STOP
The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987 , after the state attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County . STOP
The inquiry soon focused on the judge . STOP
Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report . STOP
When the judge bought his new *CUNK* from James E. Black *CUNK-* in *CUNK* five years ago , the dealership had `` certain *UNKS* '' about the judge 's reputation , according to the *UNK-* report . STOP
The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction *UNKED* by *CUNK* 's local *UNKER* , *CUNK* Bank . STOP
Then , as an additional *UNKION* , the car dealership took the judge 's *UNK* as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents . STOP
But when the judge received his payment book , he *UNKED* the deal . STOP
`` There was no loan , there is no loan , there never shall be a loan , '' the judge wrote the bank on his judicial *UNK* , according to the report . STOP
Later , the judge went a step *UNKER* . STOP
After *CUNK* Bank tried to *UNKS* the car , a vice president asked him to *UNK* in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account . STOP
The judge wrote again . STOP
`` I find myself in an *UNK* relationship with *CUNK* Bank , and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report . STOP
`` Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with *CUNK* bank in the near future , I may be inclined to *UNKER* your request ... . '' STOP
The judge now says it was `` *UNUNK* '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to *UNK* there . '' STOP
The bank *UNKED* . STOP
It *UNKED* the judge 's loan , lowered its interest rate and accepted a *UNK-* that had n't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up 1981 *CUNK* *CUNKION* the dealer had to repair before it could be *UNK* . STOP
The incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank . STOP
Two years later , he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ 10,000 loan was `` absolutely *OUS* . '' STOP
Paul L. *CUNK* , *CUNK* 's president at the time , quickly responded . STOP
The bank , he wrote back , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by 3.5 % , `` as a *UNKION* to you . '' STOP
The judge says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial , although he contends that if he were as *UNK* as state prosecutors believe , he would be far *UNKER* than he is . STOP
His *UNK-* *UNK* and *UNK* house outside of *CUNK* is up for sale to pay for his lawyers . STOP
The judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench . STOP
Already , he notes , the 76 charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to 27 . STOP
